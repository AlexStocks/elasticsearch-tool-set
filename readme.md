## Elasticsearch Problem
* [ES java very high CPU usage 100%](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4288) - Force all memory to be locked, forcing the JVM to never swap.

  To solve 100% es cpu problems, my suggestion is as follows:
  - 1 close every shard's replica;
  - 2 set the refresh interval of every index from the default value 1s to 5 or 30s;
  - 3 set the minimum java memory space equal to its maximum value when es startups.
